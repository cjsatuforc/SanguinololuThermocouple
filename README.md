#Sanguinololu Thermocouple#
I wanted to add a thermocouple to my 3D printer's hot end. Ideally it would improve the quality of my printed objects as it would provide more accurate temperature readings with greater immunity from electronic noise generated by the stepper motors.

<!---Current GitHub project page at: http://pinski1.github.io/SanguinololuThermocouple (In theory)-->

##Buying or Building One##
Version 1 was the first hardware released for manufacture, you can see it [here](https://github.com/pinski1/SanguinololuThermocouple/commit/2f19cecab5cc36e65c2b1bc9324b2c51e95554b9). The legacy documentation page is available [here](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Project:Sanguinololu_Thermocouple). Version 2 will include changes to aid manufacturing and testing.

###The Ingredients###
* [MAX31855KASA+](http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/7273) - The current version of the MAX6675 thermocouple to digital temperature IC.
* [TXB0104D](http://www.ti.com/product/txb0104) - A 4 channel bi-directional level translator, it translates the +5V logic of the Sanguinololu to the +3.3V logic of the MAX31855 and back.
* Voltage Regulator - Any SOT23-5 package +3.3V LDO regulator that can output ~100mA should do.

###Buying One###
I intend to run a Tindie Fundraiser for a batch of ~100 of these boards, however I need to finish designing version 2 and documenting test and manufacturing procedures.

When it is available I will update this page.

###Build Instructions###
_Yet to come_

##Usage##
While the board is easy to install <!---include installation pictures--> the current firmwares available for 3D printers do not support MAX31855 ICs without some editing.

###Sprinter###
A git Pull request has been issued however it is still outstanding, the pull request can be viewed to see the required modifications.

###Marlin###
No work has been done yet, however one can view the Sprinter pull request to get an idea of what needs to be changed.

###Teacup and others###
No work has begun.
