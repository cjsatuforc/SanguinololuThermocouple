I wanted to add a thermocouple to my 3D printer's hot end. Ideally it would improve the quality of my printed objects as it would provide more accurate temperature readings with greater immunity from electronic noise generated by the stepper motors.

Version 1 was the first hardware released for manufacture, you can see it here:
